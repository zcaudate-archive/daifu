"Code metrics for our system on a commit by commit and historical basis allow for detail analytics into the health of our codebase. The integrity of a system is not just a pass/fail type check, it is a set of statistics and profiles that change over time. Exposing these profiles can help make better decisions about where to improve our system - much like how a doctor prescribes treatments based upon a patient's heart-rate, blood pressure, iron-levels, etc.

Metrics give us insight into our system, and using a combination of statistics as well as looking at key indicators of code over time, we can determine, the healthiness of our codebase. If we can provide metrics and views on how a system is performing over time, then it will be in our best interest to make it better and better. The origin of the name 大夫 or `daifu` is chinese and means doctor."
